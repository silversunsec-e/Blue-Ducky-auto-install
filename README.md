This is an autoinstaller bash script for BlueDucky!

Save this as install_bluetooth_tools.sh

Run: 
  chmod +x install_bluetooth_tools.sh
  ./install_bluetooth_tools.sh

This script will clean up after itself by removing the cloned repositories.
Ensure you have sudo privileges.
The script is idempotent and will not prompt for input.
